## archlinux-checkrestart

This is an Arch Linux port of the checkrestart utility available in
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/en/jessie/debian-goodies). It
tries to find processes that need to be restarted to apply upgrades by scanning
processes using libraries and binaries that were changed or no longer exist.
For more information, you can consult
[the man page](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/debian-goodies/checkrestart.1.en.html).

### Installing

You can install [checkrestart](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/checkrestart/)
from the AUR via your preferred method (clone and makepkg, yaourt, pacaur, etc).
